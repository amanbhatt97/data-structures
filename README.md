## Dynamic Arrays

Dynamic arrays, also known as resizable arrays, provide a flexible way to store and manipulate collections of elements. Learn how to implement dynamic arrays from scratch and understand their underlying mechanics.

## Stacks

Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Explore the concept of stacks, their operations, and various applications such as expression evaluation and backtracking algorithms.

## Queues

Queues adhere to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle and are essential in scenarios where tasks should be processed in the order they are received. Dive into the world of queues, their types, and real-world use cases.

## Hashing

Hashing is a technique used to map data to fixed-size values, typically for rapid data retrieval. Learn about hash functions, collision resolution, and applications like hash tables.

## Searching

Efficient searching algorithms are vital for quickly finding desired elements in datasets. Discover linear search, binary search, and their implementations, along with when to use each approach.

## Sorting

Sorting rearranges elements into a particular order, enhancing data access and manipulation. Study various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, and their pros and cons.
